# Fake user REST API

This is a rest api project made with Node.js, Express, Mongo DB, Mongoose.
This project is made only for practise purpose.


## Installation

As I mentioned that it's a REST API made with node.js So there are some dependencies which I install for use it locally. I use express, mongoose and nodemon for use it locally.

You can simply run 

```bash
  npm install
```

to download all dependencies for this project.

This command will start nodemon and you are ready to working with it. 
```bash
  npm run dev
```
